## Hello! We're Archcord!
We're an organisation working to unify Arch Linux communities over Discord, Revolt and other platforms. Our goal is to create a friendly, welcoming community where all can show themselves for who they truly are!

# About Us!
Established in May 2024, we've been working towards a brighter future for Arch Linux communities, supporting other distributions in the process including EndeavourOS, Ubuntu, Fedora & more!

# Our Community
Our community is ever evolving, and ever growing. Become one of us and help shape the future of Arch Communities across the internet! We're on the approach to 1,000 members so join while you can!

# Our Core Values
We believe that all should have access to support, friends and a welcoming community! We also believe in equality for all no matter race, gender or region of origin. We focus on making sure everyone can access the resources they need to improve!
